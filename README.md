## Introduction

Have you been tinkering around with these cheap and accesible Arduino-boards for a while, and felt like. Hmm whats the next step?

The [Arduino Nano Every](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-every) board is equipped with the [ATmega4809 microcontroller](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATMEGA4809) (The [megaAVRÂ® 0-Series](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/megaAVR0-series-Family-Data-Sheet-DS40002015B.pdf), which also includes ATmega808, ATmega809, ATmega1608, ATmega1609, ATmega3208, ATmega3209 and ATmega4808) that came to market in 2019. It is a modern replacement of the 20 year old ATmega328p with being better in almost every regard save EEPROM that is just a quarter of the previous. It has an 8-bit AVR processor developed by Microchip/Atmel that can run up to 20MHz on an internal clock crystal. It comes with 6KB of SRAM, 48KB of flash, and 256 bytes of EEPROM. The chip features the latest technologies like flexible and efficient-power architecture, including Event System and Sleepwalking, precious analog features, and advanced peripherals.

The Arduino Nano Every differentiate itself somewhat from other Arduino boards with an Atmel processor. Usually a bootloader is present in Flash memory for uploading software to the microcontroller. The Nano Every does not use an bootloader but is programmed directly by the Unified Program and Debug Interface (UDPI) protocol. The  UPDI is a Microchip proprietary interface for external programming and on-chip debugging of a device. This programming can be done directly with harware tools like the [Atmel-ICE Debugger](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/pr/GUID-DDB0017E-84E3-4E77-AAE9-7AC4290E5E8B-en-US-4/index.html?GUID-9B349315-2842-4189-B88C-49F4E1055D7F) or by software [jtag2udpi](https://github.com/ElTangas/jtag2updi#) in an embedded processor. In this case the ATSAMD11D14A ARM Cortex M0+ processor acts as a bridge between USB and the main ATmega4809 microcontroller. The upside of not using a bootloader is obvious. You have the entire memory space for your own project and can also develop your own bootloaders without have to worry about bricking it. UDPI is also much quicker than using a bootloader, usually just a few seconds. In this sense I personally think the **Nano Every is the coolest and most versatile** of the entire lineup of Arduino AVR development boards. For a very cheap price you get both the development board and a USB cable that has very few drawbacks and at no extra cost added in the future, as often is the case in embedded development as you might find out ;)

The description here is general enought for pro development in C for all the AVR microcontrollers on the MacOS, like:

	tinyAVR: tinyAVR 1-series: attiny212, attiny214 ...
	megaAVR: ATmega3208, ATmega3209 and ATmega4808 ...
	AVR Dx:
	XMEGA:

## Arduino IDE
Arduino is designed to make the microcontroller world more accessible to students and beginners. The [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) is excellent to get you started in embedded programming. The excellent  thing with the Arduino hardware is that it is absolutely general and not locked down to or limited to use only with the Arduino IDE. The Arduino version of C++ is adapted to work with many different processors and different architechtures. In some sense the least common denominator governs how and what can be done within the framework. To unleash the full potential of the ATmega4809 you need to use its native libraries and do programming in standard C.

## Bare Metal Development
If you develop in Windows it is easy to get started with [Microchip Studio](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio) which is free of cost and a very nice environment to work in. With that said. However. If you, like me, are used to work in an UNIX environment the locked in Windows environment feels a bit narrow at times, especially if you are used to do development and programming on Ubuntu or MacOS. In industry Windows is standard but for many students and researchers at university are more used to Apple laptops and desktops.


For those of us who are used to develop with standard C (C99) in UNIX for Apple Silicon, Ubuntu or Fedora and want to get started there are fewer alternatives than in Windows that is standard for electronics and microcontroller development.

We are going to set up our environment to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as editor instead of Arduino IDE or Microchip Studio. It is superior for software development when code is running big and for working in shared project over GitHub. 

<img src="doc/pic/make.png"  width="600">

Compiling and uploading the c-code to the board takes place in **Bash** by calling a Makefile with the **make** command:

	make         # Compiles the C-program
	make flash   # Flash the program to the controller
	make serial  # Starts the serial monitor to the controller

<img src="doc/pic/tio.png"  width="600">

To connect to the board a serial interface is needed. We are going to use [tio](https://github.com/tio/tio) for this which is a simple serial device tool which features a straightforward command-line and configuration file interface to easily connect to serial TTY devices for basic I/O operations. To make a simpler serial device tool for talking with serial TTY devices with less focus on classic terminal/modem features and more focus on the needs of embedded developers and hackers.

## Installation, Configuration and Test
### Follow these steps to install a complete system:

### 1) Arduino IDE

<img src="doc/pic/install_ide.png"  width="400">

Download the latest [Arduino IDE](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2) and install it if you have not already done so. We are going to use its [avr toolchain](https://github.com/arduino/toolchain-avr) for **avr-gcc** compiler and tools. 

### 2) Homebrew
You need to install [Homebrew](https://mac.install.guide/homebrew/index.html) in order to install a few crucial components to get the system running.

Once Homebrew is installed, install the following programs.

	brew install make
	brew install tio
	brew install avrdude
	
### 3) Install source
Installing the source code from this GitHub page

	git clone git@github.com:fuxelius/nano_every_bare_metal.git
	cd nano_every_bare_metal

### 4) Visual Studio Code
Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and open the *nano\_every\_bare\_metal* directory.
	
### 5) Set path to avr-gcc in Arduino Library
Find out the right path to your avr-gcc binaries, and edit this path in *Makefile*

	ARDUINO_BIN = ~/Library/Arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avr-gcc/7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino5/bin
	
### 6) Test if it works

	make
	make flash
	make serial
	
When you flash the software the USB device is shown, Use it to connect the serial to the board. In this case the device name is: /dev/cu.usbmodem2244201

	tio /dev/cu.usbmodem2244201 -b 9600 -d 8 -p none -s 1
	
	
Now it should show a scrolling 'Hello world!'

Quit serial with CTRL+T Q
	
## C Development

descibe file structure and separate compilation, the .deploy and .object directory

[AVR Libc](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__pgmspace.html)

[AVR Libc 2.1.0 Manual](doc/avr-libc-user-manual-2.1.0.pdf)

[avr-gcc compiler flags](doc/avr-gcc compiler flags.html)

When you read the [datasheet](doc/ATmega4808-09-DataSheet-DS40002173C.pdf) for the atmega4809 microcontroller it is handy to look at its [header file](doc/iom4809.h) for naming registers and ports in c-code. 


## Some C Books

<img src="doc/pic/k_and_r.png"  width="200">



The [C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628) (sometimes termed K&R, after its authors' initials) is a computer programming book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, the latter of whom originally designed and implemented the language, as well as co-designed the Unix operating system with which development of the language was closely intertwined. The book was central to the development and popularization of the C programming language and is still widely read and used today. Because the book was co-authored by the original language designer, and because the first edition of the book served for many years as the de facto standard for the language, the book was regarded by many to be the authoritative reference on C

## Systems internals

### The Makefile

TARGET: the name of the project, resulting name is TARGET.hex. Change it to a proper name for your project

CLOCK: The fuses are set to 16MHz and default for 4809 is to divide by 6 that gives 2666666

FUSES: These are given in the [datasheet](doc/ATmega4808-09-DataSheet-DS40002173C.pdf)

DEVICE: You can get the proper name to support other AVR MCUs than 4809 in [Microchip Packs Repository](https://packs.download.atmel.com)

PARTNO that goes into the [avrdude](https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude#) command line comes from the list of supported AVR microcontrollers in the avrdude [manual](https://avrdudes.github.io/avrdude/) . Here you can find all supported devices. So m4809 is a short for ATmega4809. If you want to use another microcontroller, just look it up in the list.

Unless you get DEVICE and PARTNO right it will not compile and upload correctly, it is bad at guessing.

TOOLCHAIN\_PATH: This refers into the library directory of the Arduino distribution, ~/Library/Arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avr-gcc/7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino5/bin. A problem with this is that it can change if a new Arduino IDE installation takes place and removes the old one. A remedy to this is to copy the AVR toolchain out of Arduino IDE to a safe place like:

	cp ~/Library/Arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avr-gcc/7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino5/bin \
	    /Volumes/Sky/AVR/avr-toolchain/


AVR\_HAXX\_PATH: This should not really reside in the same folder as the code, but shold be moved to the same folder as TOOLCHAIN\_PATH resides in, so:

	mv avr_haxx /Volumes/Sky/AVR/avr_haxx

Now AVR tools resides locally:

	/Volumes/Sky/AVR/avr-toolchain/...
	/Volumes/Sky/AVR/avr_haxx/..
	
The updated paths in the Makefile should look like:

	TOOLCHAIN_PATH  = /Volumes/Sky/AVR/avr-toolchain/bin
	AVR_HAXX_PATH   = /Volumes/Sky/AVR-GCC/avr_haxx	
	
The C-project folders should now only have the Makefile and C-code to operate correctly


### Others

[Microchip Packs Repository](https://packs.download.atmel.com)

[Toolchains for AVR Microcontrollers](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio/gcc-compilers)

Microchip.ATmega_DFP.3.0.158.atpack

Microchip does not make it easy. Instead of them simply providing a full avr-libc to build, we have to hack things together. Hopefully "upstream" avr-libc will soon support tinyAVR 1-series (like attiny1614), and this could be skipped.

Get Atmel/Microchip ATtiny_DFP Pack (try http://packs.download.atmel.com/) It is called something like "Atmel.ATtiny_DFP.1.3.229.atpack". It's really just a zip archive with .atpack extention.

Unpack and enter into directory, then we must copy the following 3 files from Atmel pack:

	gcc/dev/attiny1614/avrxmega3/libattiny1614.a,
	gcc/dev/attiny1614/avrxmega3/crtattiny1614.o,
	include/avr/iotn1614.h:

### Supporting Other AVR Microcontrollers
The avr_haxx has files to support for the entire [megaAVRÂ® 0-Series](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/megaAVR0-series-Family-Data-Sheet-DS40002015B.pdf) of microcontrollers:
 	
 	ATmega808
	ATmega1608
	ATmega1609
	ATmega3208
	ATmega3209 
	ATmega4808
	ATmega4809
